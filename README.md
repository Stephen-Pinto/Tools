Basic tools for day to day activities

## DuplicateSniffer
Its a simple tool created to figure out all the duplicates within a root folder. This will check the packages using CRC to ensure that the file contents too are exactly the same before listing it.
Pretty useful for duplicate photos or just any files.
Time of execution depends on the size of files with the directory or the drive supplied.
Note: To build this project you need the boost library and provide its path to the project.

## JfxPassword Manager
This was an initial attempt in making a password manager in Java and using SpringBoot technology. Although this project was not completed it serves as a good reference at any future attempts.
